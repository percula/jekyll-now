### About Me

Hello, world! I'm Peter Keefe, and I specialize in the design and development of Android apps. I'm currently working on my Capstone Project for Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree, and previously completed the Android Basics Nanodegree, which I finished within a week's time to earn a scholarship to my current Nanodegree program. I've always enjoyed programming but only recently decided to switch careers to programming. Before the switch, I worked on nuclear submarines for the US Navy as a mechanical engineer, where I did lots of structural calculations and finite element analysis. Besides Android development, I also dabble in web development (such as this site!).

When I'm not coding, I love spending time in the outdoors hiking and kayaking. I am also a saltwater aquarium enthusiast.

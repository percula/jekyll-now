Hello, world! This is my first blog post using GitHub Pages. I just forked the barryclark's jekyll-now repository and followed his [simple instructions](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) to get the blog up and running. Next steps: add my custom domain (perculacreative.com).
